## Question 3. Count records

**How many taxi trips were there on January 15?
Consider only trips that started on January 15.**

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(tpep_pickup_datetime)
FROM public.yellow_taxi_data
WHERE 
	tpep_pickup_datetime >= '2021-01-15 00:00:00' AND
	tpep_pickup_datetime < '2021-01-16 00:00:00'
```

| trips |
|-------|
| 53024 |

**There were 53,024 trips on January 15 of 2021.**

## Question 4. Largest tip for each day

**Find the largest tip for each day. On which day it was the largest tip in January?**

**Use the pick up time for your calculations.**

**(note: it's not a typo, it's "tip", not "trip")**

```sql
SELECT
	DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime),
	MAX(tip_amount) AS max_tip_day
FROM public.yellow_taxi_data 
GROUP BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime)
HAVING DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) < '2021-02-01'
ORDER BY max_tip_day DESC;
```

## Question 6. Most expensive locations

**What's the pickup-dropoff pair with the largest average price for a ride (calculated based on total_amount)?**

**Enter two zone names separated by a slash**

**For example:**

**"Jamaica Bay / Clinton East"**

**If any of the zone names are unknown (missing), write "Unknown". For example, "Unknown / Clinton East".**
